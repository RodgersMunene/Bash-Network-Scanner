# Bash-Network-Scanner

</br>
A simple basic bash script;
</br>
uses a for loop to ping through a network and find live hosts.
</br>
uses an if statement to maintain correct syntax.
</br>
</br>
1. Checks for Input: ensures you provide an IP address when running the script.
</br>
2. Scans Network: pings all devices in the specified IP range (e.g., 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254).
</br>
3. Filters Responses: displays the IP addresses of devices that respond to the ping.
</br>
4. Runs concurrently: scans multiple IPs at once to speed up the process.
